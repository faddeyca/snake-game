- There are 3 types of food:
    1. Red apple - increases your length and gives you 1 point
    2. Gray poison - increases your speed
    3. Magic apple - gives you 10 points, however, you should catch it
- When you hit a wall or snake's body, you lose one life and you become deadless for a short time to get out of a dangerous situation.
- When the snake reaches a certain length you move to a new level
